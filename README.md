2. **Configure APIs**: Check and update the files in the `constants/` directory to specify the backend APIs.

3. **Start development server**: Use `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the Vite development server.

4. **Build for production**: To build the application for production, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. This will create an optimized version of the application in the `dist/` directory.

5. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to the production server using the files from the `dist/` directory.
